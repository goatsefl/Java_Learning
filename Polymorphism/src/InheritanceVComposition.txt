Issues with Inheritance:

1. Tight Coupling: Inheritance creates a tight coupling between classes, leading to:
    - Reduced Flexibility: Changes in the superclass can ripple through to subclasses, potentially breaking code.
    - Limited Reuse: Subclasses are inherently tied to their superclass, making them less reusable in different contexts.

2. The "Is-A" vs. "Has-A" Relationship: Inheritance implies an "is-a" relationship, which isn't always appropriate. Composition, on the other hand, models a "has-a" relationship, which often better reflects real-world relationships between objects.

3. Overuse of Inheritance: Excessive use of inheritance can lead to complex class hierarchies that are difficult to maintain and understand.

4. Single Inheritance Restriction: Java only allows single inheritance from a superclass, limiting flexibility in modeling multiple relationships.

5. Fragile Base Class Problem: Changes to a base class can have unintended consequences for derived classes, making it "fragile" to modifications.

Benefits of Composition:

- Loose Coupling: Classes are more independent and less affected by changes in other classes.
- Increased Flexibility: Components can be easily added, removed, or replaced without affecting the overall structure.
- Better Encapsulation: Composition promotes better encapsulation by hiding implementation details within objects.
- Enhanced Testability: Composed classes are often easier to test in isolation due to their reduced dependencies.

When to Choose Composition:

- When modeling "has-a" relationships over "is-a" relationships.
- When prioritizing flexibility and maintainability.
- When avoiding tight coupling between classes.
- When designing for testability.

In summary, while inheritance has its place in object-oriented design, composition often provides a more flexible, maintainable, and testable approach to code organization in Java.
